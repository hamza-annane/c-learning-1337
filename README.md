# 🚀 C Programming Learning Journey – 1337 School Preparation

Welcome to my learning journey through the fundamentals of **C programming**, part of my personal preparation for 1337 School.

This roadmap is designed to gradually build a strong foundation in C, starting from the basics (variables and conditions) to more advanced topics (pointers, structs, and algorithms). The content is split into **weekly modules** with theoretical notes and hands-on exercises, including mini-projects to reinforce what I’ve learned.

## 📅 Weekly Learning Plan

### **Week 00 – The Basics**
- `01-Variables.md`: Introduction to variables and data types.
- `02-ConditionsL1.md`: Basic conditional logic in C.
- `03-ConditionsL2.md`: Advanced conditions and logical operators.
- `04-BouclesL1.md`: Introduction to loops (while, for, do-while).

---

### **Week 01 – Arrays, Loops & Functions**
- `05-Tableaux.md`: Understanding arrays and their usage.
- `06-BouclesL2.md`: More complex loop patterns and nested loops.
- `07-Fonctions.md`: Defining and using functions in C.
- `mini-projet.md`: Mini-project to apply everything learned so far.

---

### **Week 02 – Pointers, Strings & Structs**
- `pointers.md`: Introduction to pointers and memory addressing.
- `08-Strings.md`: Working with strings and character arrays.
- `09-Struct.md`: Understanding `structs` and data organization.
- `mini-projet.md`: Mini-project focused on strings and structs.

---

### **Week 03 – Algorithms**
- `10-Algos.md`: Essential algorithms and problem-solving patterns.

## 🛠️ Tools & Resources

- Compiler: GCC
- IDE: Visual Studio Code / Vim
- Resources: 1337 School Materials, Online C References (cppreference, tutorialspoint)

## 🧠 Progress & Reflections

I will be updating this repository as I complete each week, documenting what I learn, the mistakes I make, and how I overcome challenges.

Stay tuned! 💻
